   %why do we care about the problem?
To set up port forwarding rules on network gateways, certain technical skills are required from end-users.
These assumptions in the gateway software stack, can lead to an increase in support calls to the network operators and resellers of customer premises equipment.
The user interface itself is also an important part of the product and a complicated interface will contribute to a lessened user experience.
Other risks with an overwhelming user interface include faulty configuration by the user, leaving the network vulnerable to potential attacks.

   %what did you actually do to get your results?

   %what did you learn/invent/create?
We present an enhancement of the current port forwarding settings, with an extensible library of presets.
To help users with detecting available services, a wrapper for a network scanner was implemented, for detecting devices and services on the local network.
These parts combined relieves end-users of looking up forwarding rules for ports and protocols to configure their gateway, basing their decisions on data collected by the network scanner or by using an applications name instead of looking up its ports.

   %what are the larger implications of your findings
Using the Nmap utility for identifying services on the network, could be considered harmful activity by network admins and intrusion detection systems.
The preset library is extensible and generic enough to be included in the default software suite shipping with the network equipment.
Working within the unified configuration system within OpenWrt, the preset design will add value and allow resellers to customize their services.
This proposal could reduce support costs for the service operators and improve user experience in configuring network gateways.

\chapter{Introduction}
%brief introduction to inteno and the product
\section{Background}
Inteno Broadband Technology is a company that supplies \emph{customer premises equipment} (CPE) for internet service providers.  
Their headquarters and \emph{research and development center} is located in Stockholm, Sweden.
Inteno Open Systems Platform, or \emph{iopsys}, is a Linux-based open source platform running on their CPE.
It is based on the OpenWrt distribution which targets embedded devices, specifically network gateways.\cite{Inteno}

The research and development department at Inteno works on improving the platform, adding value to the end users, the operators and the larger OpenWrt software ecosystem.
By the nature of OpenWrt's free software licence\cite{gnu-license}, the code is publicly released and available for download from Intenos webpage.\cite{inteno_gpl}

There are simple ways in which to improve the user experience, developers of network gateway software often implement a set of presets of port forwarding rules for common applications.
The interface presents the user with a list of application names and lets the user select an IP address, for which the forwarding rules should apply.

Working from the theory that a good user experience lies in the details, iterative improvements of the system is the preferred way to address it.
This project contributes to the ongoing work of improving details of user experience, strengthening the product and saving costs for support.

%identified a real problem (motivate that it is real and interesting)
The technical support departments of partners and resellers of Inteno CPE, are looking to reduce support costs and improve customer experience. 
Support issues creates costs for the business and by reducing the number of support tickets and their processing time, these can be reduced.

\section{Goals}
%come up with a solution (give a rough idea what the solution looks like)
Simplifying configuration by abstracting common tasks for the end-user aims to relieve customers and technical support staff.
Using automatic device identification and automating common tasks such as port forwarding, will result in savings in support along with a better user experience.
This project will investigate the simplification of usability when configuring port forwarding and evaluate the changes.
Many common support issues could be automated by the software running on the CPE and by effective communication with the end-user through the user interface, these improvements would also aid first-line support when guiding the customer over phone.
In order to even begin configuring the device, the correct IP address to the CPE has to be typed in the web browsers address bar.
A script which performs an automatic DNS translation from domain name to its LAN IP address will be developed.
The project goals can be summarized as:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Preset library of port forwarding rules
   \item Automatic detection of services on the local network devices
   \item Evaluate usability
   \item Internal DNS translation of the gateway IP address
\end{itemize}

\section{Delimitations}
% what to accomplish
% mention literature study? if I ever finish it
One purpose of this degree project is to achieve a more user friendly operation by adding automatic service discovery on the local network within the OpenWrt system.
A system which identifies the ports and services running on the network devices is developed, this works alongside the preset library for port forwarding, to reduce the amount and duration of support calls.
These parts will work together, integrated into the web-based interface of OpenWrt.
The internal DNS translation system will work independently from the rest of the project, it will not be dependant on either the preset library or the service detection.

% what not to accomplish
It is assumed that operation of the device is user friendlier, when the end-user receive helpful hints and a more interactive workflow in the configuration process.
The internal DNS translation for reaching the front-end of the CPE through an internal domain name, does not account for various browser implementations of the address bar, which could sometimes interpret a domain address as a search query.
Evaluation of usability is meant to be qualitative and focuses on reason rather than test groups.
The actual effect on support costs is out of the scope of this degree project.

\section{Solutions}
%how I actually solved the problem (high-level summary of results).
By building a library of presets for common port forwarding rules and developing a simple selection dialog, the end user can more efficiently set up port their firewall redirection rules and general configuration of their gateway.
A limited range of settings and automatic portforwarding settings are presented to the user.

For the system of service identification, a wrapper around a port scanner is implemented, which performs a scan of the network nodes and returns a list of available services.
This information is in turn used to match against the known presets and protocols, and offers the user a choice of applying the preset rules for the newly detected network device.
% skriv klart angående att tack vare ramverket så kan åf lägga till egna regler.
The preset system is extensible, allowing retailers to add their own devices and services as preset definitions, each with their specific forwarding rules.

DNS translation of the gateway IP address, allows easy access through the web browser by simply entering a domain name in the address bar, which should be easier for users than remembering or figuring out its IP.
This works by translating the gateways internal IP address to a domain name and keeping it up to date whenever the IP is changed.

\section{Design and layout}
%skriva lite literaturstudie om design av användargränssnitt
User interface and the graphical and sometimes physical design, is an important part of the brand and ease of use of products.
%cite dont blame yourself if the product is confusing
Improving the graphical interface in electronic devices and its software, can cause irritations with the product and leave the user with a sense of hopelessness and self-blame.\cite[p.~34]{norman2002design}
It is important to communicate a clear usage that is as unambiguous as possible to the user, this was decided to be the most important part of the layout.
This was the main goal of the user experience, removing the possibility of misstep and communicating clearly, citing Krug's second law of usability\cite[p.~41]{krug2006don}, ``It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice''.

   \caption{Flowchart for configuring port forwarding, illustrating differences in user interaction with the conventional port forwarding tab (left chart), to the one presented in this paper (right chart)}
   \label{fig:usability}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:usability}, we see a conceptual flowchart of the all the steps in the current user interaction when port forwarding, the two parts called ``Look it up!'' requires a switch of context which can delay the configuration of the port forwarding.
The mental steps and actions within the gray area of figure \ref{fig:usability}, will form a loop every time the service has several protocols and ports.

In addition to the ``Look it up!'' steps, in the example of the XBox 360 -- which has four ports -- the user have to perform seven additional actions for the three remaining ports:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Select host
   \item Enter protocol and port
   \item Enter description
\end{itemize}

One goal of this degree project is presenting a more guiding and interactive approach, which results in fewer mental steps

\section{Guided firewall tab}
In the projects improved port forwarding dialog, the user is confronted with fewer mental steps.
As shown in figure \ref{fig:usability}, 

\section{Alternative using a locally run application}
%skriv något om alternativa program typ port scanner och guider på nätet
To test the newly applied configurations, web-based or locally run port scanners can be used, as opposed to a gateway-centric port forwarding solution presented by this report.
They will scan the users external IP address for open ports and present which are open, however this does not guarantee that the packets are routed to the correct internal address.

Alternative solutions to simplifying port forwarding include using standalone applications which run on a PC, connected to the local network.
These applications also use internal lists of port forwarding rules for common applications and devices, which is then applied for a specific IP address on the local network.\cite{portforward.com}

\section{Programming languages}
\subsection{Lua}
Lua is a programming language that is intended to be embeddable and extensible, it is implemented in C and enables the developer to employ different programming techniques with its multi-paradigm approach.
The programming languages it is distributed with a permissive free software licence\cite{mit-license}, while being open source allowing use within proprietary software.
The language is dynamically typed, which means that the underlying variable type is determined at runtime and supports features such as memory management, closures and first-class functions.\nocite{ierusalimschy2006programming}
%motivera valet av Lua, Model-View Controller framework LuCI använder Lua?

Implementation-wise the language is small in size yet expressive, which makes it suitable for higher level programming in embedded systems such as network gateways.
Since the web user interface of OpenWrt uses Lua, it was beneficial to implement as much of the application in the programming language, as a Lua Configuration Interface module.
See section \ref{sec:LuCI} for details on \emph{Lua Configuration Interface}, or LuCI.

\subsection{Almquist shell}
Adhering to the POSIX standards, Almquist shell\footnote{Also called \emph{sh}, \emph{A shell} or \emph{ash}} on OpenWrt it is the default operating system command-line interface, scripting language and command processor.
It has less features than \emph{bash} and sometimes requires a strict and sometimes more verbose scripting style, without the permissiveness of bash idioms, such practices are referred to as \emph{bashism} and are often incompatible with ash.

Shell scripting allows the developer to aggregate the power of a range of UNIX programs, using redirection to route the output of one program to the input of another, and with the shell prompt as an interactive development environment it allows for rapid prototyping.
The permissiveness and features of bash, has brought along handy constructs such as \emph{process substitution}, which is unavailable in ash.
Instead the developer has to resort to manually handling named pipes, which creates a temporary buffer in which the processes can exchange data.
An example redirecting the output from a command a named pipe, and processing the output of that command is available in appendix \ref{fig:fifo}.

\subsection{JavaScript}

\section{Software suite}

The newer Inteno devices ship with the OpenWrt distribution, which is a small GNU/Linux operating system.
It provides the developer with the basic UNIX debugging tools and a POSIX compatible command-line interface shell.
As common with free software, the OpenWrt exists in an ecosystem of applications and tools, in this chapter a few of these parts are discussed.

\subsection{OpenWrt}
OpenWrt is a free and open-source GNU/Linux distribution, targeting embedded devices, specifically wireless routers, but can run on almost any set of hardware.
Cross-compilation is enabled by OpenWrt Buildroot, which compiles the C code using uClibc, a lightweight C library focusing on embedded Linux systems. 
It intends to be a meta distribution and offers developers a framework on which to base their firmware on.

OpenWrt is generally compiled and linked using gcc and binutils, with the help of Makefiles and patches for the various gcc versions and target platforms.
Allowing end users as well as service operators and hardware manufacturers to compile the firmware.
It offers the BusyBox set of barebones UNIX tools, enabling advanced users to fully interact with their Linux system and providing developers with a familiar platform for debugging and testing their product.\cite{OpenWrt:structure_design}

\emph{Unified Configuration Interface}, or UCI, is used in OpenWrt as a uniform format for commonly used configuration files.
UCI has a Lua bindings as well as a command line interface, to read and modify the configuration files.
Rules for port forwarding are defined in the UCI compatible configuration file in:
\begin{verbatim}
    /etc/config/firewall
\end{verbatim}

A port forwarding rule which forwards external HTTP traffic over port 80 to the internal IP 192.168.1.214, is shown in figure \ref{fig:redirect_conf} in appendix \ref{appA}.
The line \emph{config redirect} defines the start of a section, a section contains several values and a UCI configuration file can have several such sections.

\subsection{OPKG}
The package management system used in OpenWrt is Open PacKaGe Management, or \emph{OPKG}. It is based off the discontinued \emph{ipkg} and operates similar to \emph{APT} and \emph{dpkg} of Debian-based distributions.
It targets GNU/Linux based operating systems for embedded devices and there are currently over 2000 OPKG packages available for OpenWrt.

The OpenWrt system and its packages are built using \emph{GNU Autoconf}, which automates tasks associated with compiling larger software suites.
This includes pulling in parts of the system from remote software repositories and automatically resolving dependencies on programs and libraries.

\subsection{Inteno Open Platform System}
For Customer Premises Equipment like wireless gateways, Inteno Open Platform System offers an open-source Linux distribution based on OpenWrt.
It uses the OpenWrt build system including cross-compilation toolchain to ensure compatibility with the ecosystem and upstream.

Inteno maintains and hosts a remote repository, which contains a frozen release of OpenWrt and compatible packages and patches.
Freezing an ever changing open source codebase means forking an existing version, submitting more conservative patches to the system and focusing on smaller changes.
This leads to good compatibility with Inteno hardware and protection from breakage because of upstream\footnote{Code released and maintained by the official project} code changes.

\subsection{Lua Configuration Interface}\label{sec:LuCI}
Lua Configuration Interface, or \emph{LuCI}, is a suite of programs and libraries for extending OpenWrt using the Lua programming language and providing a web interface built with the Model-View Controller architecture.
It originated in the OpenWrt project, but is now an independent project on its own.

\subsection{Model-View Controller}
LuCI relies on the \emph{Model-View Controller} software architecture pattern and separates data and its visual representation.
It is divides in three parts with the model representing the data and storing in in UCI configuration files.

\chapter{Problem}
   \section{User experience}
End users of Inteno CPE have expressed concern about the relative difficulty of port forwarding and configuration of their network gateway.
The default settings page for port forwarding is currently located under the \emph{Firewall} tab in the OpenWrt front end, the forwarding procedure involves looking up ports for the specific device or unit, and entering these on the web page forms.

These set of rules sometimes involve several ports and protocols, increasing the possibility for misstep and faulty configuration by the end user.
If we could reduce the complexities of this common task of address translation and present it in an way that are easily understandable, then customer satisfaction would increase.
Such tasks could be well suited for automation by software, especially for applications and devices which require several port forwarding rules, automating some of these steps will save time and bring overall value to the user experience.


   \section{Customer support}
Connectivity of the XBox 360 gaming console has been a common issue and the device is common among end users, this was also chosen as reference device to do tests and verifications against.
One of the most commonly reported issues of end users, is setting up port forwarding for connecting their XBox 360 to the XBox Live network.

\chapter{Implementation}
The overall design of the system consists of two parts, the service identification and port forwarding presets.
These parts are connected through the underlying software and presented on the user interface.

As shown in figure~\ref{fig:wizard-seq_dia}, the communication between the parts of the port forwarding process is outlined.
The user initiates the identification procedure and the identification process starts.
When the results from the identification are returned the list of presets is sorted, based on identification and the user can review their options.

\begin{figure}[h!]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[trim = 0mm 195mm 30mm 0mm, clip, width=15cm,natwidth=1.0in,natheight=1.0in]{wizard-seq_dia}
   \caption{Sequential diagram of applying port forwarding rules, the User box represents the view or the user interaction part of the implementation}
   \label{fig:wizard-seq_dia}
\end{figure}
%   \section{Human-computer interaction}
%This is a cite\cite{garrett2003elements}

By selecting the name of the service, the correct forwarding rules are loaded and presented to the user, who can then chose to apply them, after which they are written to the configuration files.

The port forwarding wizard works with the standard OpenWrt configuration files\footnote{OpenWrt can be configured using Unified Configuration System, or UCI. It also provides a command-line utility and provides an API for programming languages such as C and Lua} and uses nmap as its backend for discovering and identifying services on the local network.

   \section{User interface}
For a port forwarding interface page, the user is presented with detected nodes and their corresponding network services, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:scanning}.
Listed presets are sorted by the output from the service identification process, presenting the user with the most likely services at the top of the list.
To apply the port forwarding rule set, the user selects a node in the network and the service from the sorted list, then applies it.

Instead of performing all the steps automatically, the user is required to interact and approve of the suggested changes.

%explain your approach in a general overview
The implementation consists of three general parts that work together in delivering easier forwarding rules configuration.
As shown in figure~\ref{fig:wizard-seq_dia}, the three configuration files that together with user input, are used as sources for the final redirection rule in the firewall configuration file.
The service detection wrapper returns the newly discovered services, these can then be matched against a preset of forwarding rules.

%The OpenWrt distribution provides a complete platform for compiling and deploying a gateway firmware image.

% $#@! Jag kan inte hitta hur metodval för att lösa uppgiften har gjorts. Du använder dig av Nmap och en Wrapper, men undersökte du andra möjligheter och varför fasnade du i sådana fall för just den här lösningen? 
\section{Nmap}
The program \emph{Nmap} is a popular network discovery program, and was chosen as the engine for the service scanner implementation.
The XBox 360 gaming console was chosen at Inteno's suggestion, with the motivation that it is one of the devices that end users have had the most issues with, in regards to port forwarding.
Nmap is capable of detecting several operating systems, embedded devices and network services.
%skriv något om probes, fingerprinting och teknikerna som används för id

Using Nmap is quite intrusive and could be detected as an attack by intrusion detection software, used to monitor the network for illicit behavior.
An alternative approach is using passive fingerprinting of network traffic, one such utility if P0f which uses passive scanning of traffic.\cite{p0f}
However, in order to provide low latency, the Inteno routers are configured with cut-through switching, which would render the passive fingerprinting of P0f ineffective.
Cut-through switching, as opposed to store and forward, starts forwarding the packets before it has been fully received, this hides hides the packet information from software processing and analyzing techniques.

\subsection{Wrapper}
Executing the Nmap scanning utility and returning results, is implemented as a shell script.
%skriv att du valde att göra shellhax istället för Lua
In the development process of the wrapper, a shell script was written to test the functionality and extract data about the detected services.
The original thought was to replace this with a Lua script, to make it more cohesive with the rest of the system.
Due to lack of time, the rewrite was cancelled and a quick adaptation was made to to the script to return valid JSON for the JavaScript frontend.

% $#@! Det vore även upplysande att se ett exempel på resultatet av en sådan extrascanning som beskrivs längst ned på sidan 11 alternativt hänvisa till information som du presenterar i Appendix.
%discuss tradeoffs, discuss traps you've fallen into
%skriv att xbox inte hittas och att du var tvungen att haxa
While testing the service identification features of Nmap, there is no way for Nmap to positively identify an XBox 360.
This failure was due to an inconclusive fingerprint, but using the flag called version scan -- run with arguments \emph{-sV} -- Nmap interrogates ports and returns more information than a regular operating system scan.
The extra scan using the Nmap \emph{version scan}, was successfully used to identify the XBox 360.
Whenever the service is identified as \emph{LSA-or-nterm}, the TCP ports 1026 and 1027, were scanned, either of these are in use by the XBox 360.\cite{aretheysecure}
A more thorough version scan is issued for the device and then matched for \emph{XBox 360 UPnP}, which the wrapper is set to interpret as a positive match and returns its service name\footnote{The XBox 360 is labeled \emph{xbox360} in the configuration presets}.

\section{Preset library}
The preset library consists of common services and port data, that the user would want to set up forwarding rules for.
Details of these ports and protocols are provided by the application developers, specifically for address translation reasons.

Using the \emph{Unified Configuration System}, which is included in the OpenWrt distribution, all the basic commands for configuring the firewall rules were prototyped and explored.
A set of \emph{XBox 360} port forwarding rules from the preset configuration file is shown in figure \ref{fig:redirect_conf} in appendix \ref{appA}.

The rules were formatted to fit the UCI configuration file format and returned as JSON to the JavaScript frontend in an AJAX call through the Lua dispatcher.\footnote{The dispatcher is the \emph{Controller} in the MVC framework}

Applying the rules requires the user to select the desired service from a list, and pressing a button which runs a JavaScript function, performing an AJAX call to the Lua backend, issuing the UCI calls.

\section{Operating system scan}
The results of the basic operating system scan of XBox 360 is shown in figure \ref{fig:nmapos}.
Note that the line:
\begin{verbatim}
   No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).
\end{verbatim}
%fixa till det här
    
We observe that the scan is unable to identify the correct operating system against the XBox 360 and had a duration of 35.78 seconds.
A more thorough scan is required to detect the gaming console in question.

This exhaustive scan takes longer to complete per port, but is limited to a small range.
The results shows that the system manages to identify the XBox 360 gaming console, using the extra scan issued by the wrapper, the device can positively be identified correctly.
Its services in terms of ports are well known and defined in the preset part of the implemented system.

\section{Linux server}
Scanning a faily standard GNU/Linux operating system\footnote{The operating system running on the Raspberry Pi is the recommended Raspbian, a Debian based distribution} running on the Raspberry Pi installed with the options \emph{web server}, \emph{mail server} and \emph{ssh server}, detect these services and ports as shown in figure \ref{fig:rasp_scan}.
The mail server option in the installer, enables identification on ports 110, 143, 993 and 995 because of the various email delivery protocols.
Every major network service is discovered, on the GNU/Linux system.

\chapter{Conclusions}
%discuss what we can learn from the results

%draw real conclusions
The preset system will simplify the port forwarding procedure and provide the novice user with helpful hints, in an otherwise complex graphical environment.
This part of the system could be made production ready and included by default in the iopsys platform.
Service detection fits with the preset data and the combination of these results results in a qualified guess about services the users might want forwarded.
Detection is currently slow and tweaking the scan arguments any more were outside the scope of this project.

The identification process of the XBox 360 is not a generic Nmap solution, it requires a workaround implemented in the shell script wrapper.
This behaviour is undesirable but perhaps acceptable, depending on the frequency of the issue.
Considering the CPE operators various needs, we are unable to draw any conclusions as to weather it should be implemented as part of the default distribution or not.

\section{Further development}
%explain how to fix shortcommings of work and how to fix them
The solution using Nmap could be interpreted as illegal activity and attempts at exploiting the systems of a network administrator, this is a risk which could render the proposed solution undesirable.
A fix for this would be to implement a less intrusive way of identifying services, reviewing the ARP tables which contains the cache of the address resolution protocol.
One could filter possible devices by their manufacturers MAC address, with an already populated ARP table this procedure is unintrusive and fast.
A more detailed Nmap \emph{version scan} could then be performed according to a configuration file, mapping MAC addresses to minimal Nmap commands.
It would be a better fit for our reference model, but more error-prone and less generic than using Nmap.

The execution time of Nmap is an issue, on local networks with several devices the latency would be deemed too high, for many use cases.
To address this issue one could adjust the service to preload the automatic identification results and have it run in the background, to provide a more responsive user experience with the cached results.
