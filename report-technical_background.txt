Technical background
====================
OpenWrt
-------

OpenWrt is a free and open-source GNU/Linux distribution, targeting embedded devices, specifically wireless routers, but can run on almost any set of hardware.
Cross-compilation is enabled by OpenWrt Buildroot, which compiles the C code using uClibc, a lightweight C library focusing on embedded Linux systems. 
It intends to be a meta distribution and offers developers a framework on which to base their firmware on.

OpenWrt is generally compiled and linked using gcc and binutils, with the help of Makefiles and patches for the various gcc versions and target platforms.
Allowing end users as well as service operators and hardware manufacturers to compile the firmware. It offers the BusyBox set of barebones UNIX tools, enabling advanced users to fully interact with their Linux system and providing developers with a familiar platform for debugging and testing their product.

OPKG
----

The package management system used in OpenWrt is OPKG. It is based off the discontinued ipkg and operates similar to APT and dpkg of Debian-based distributions.
There are currently over 2000 OPKG packages available for OpenWrt.

The OpenWrt system and its packages are built using GNU Autoconf.

Inteno Open Platform System
---------------------------

For Customer Premises Equipment\footnote{commonly abbreviated as CPE} like wireless gateways, Inteno Open Platform System offers an open-source Linux distribution based on OpenWrt.
It uses the OpenWrt build system including cross-compilation toolchain to ensure compatibility with the ecosystem and upstream.

Building LuCI
-------------
The LuCI package is pulled from Intenos repository at:

    http://ihgsp.inteno.se/git/luci-inteno.git

And is defined in the file:

    package/luci/luci/Makefile

The working repository is kept locally on my machine and the LuCI repository is
instead pointing to a repository on the local machine.

    ../../../../luci-simon/

Lua Configuration Interface
---------------------------
LuCI is an suite of programs and libraries for extending OpenWrt using the Lua
programming language. It originated in the OpenWrt project but has since grown
and is now it's own project.
http://luci.subsignal.org/trac

The themes are accessed from the directory:

    root@Inteno:/usr/lib/lua/luci/view/themes/

### Port forwarding
Rules for port forwarding are read from:

    /etc/config/firewall

A port forwarding rule which forwards external HTTP traffic over port 80 to the
local IP 192.168.1.214, looks like:

config redirect               
        option target 'DNAT' 
        option src 'wan'
        option dest 'lan'
        option proto 'tcp'
        option src_dport '80'
        option dest_ip '192.168.1.214'
        option dest_port '80' 
        option name 'Web server'

The presentation markup for the current port forwarding page in the LuCI
backend on the Gateway, is defined in the file:

    luci-inteno/applications/luci-firewall/luasrc/view/firewall/cbi_addforward.htm

    libs/core/luasrc/model/firewall.lua :555

in the functions:

    function redirect.*

Lua programming language
------------------------
Lua is a multi-paradigm programming language. 

Node identification
-------------------
To ensure the configuration of the gateway is as pain-free as possible, certain
techniques for identifying nodes on the network enhance the user experience.
